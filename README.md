A simple WhatsApp bot built using the Baileys library. This bot automates group management tasks, including:

Sending welcome messages to new members.
Issuing warnings for unauthorized link posts (excluding admins and group owners).
Restricting functionality to groups where the bot is an admin.
The bot is written in JavaScript and leverages Node.js for backend processing.
